# TreeQuencer parameters

# The GameNumber parameter is for choosing between the TreeQuencer games
# 0 is the standard game with the random nodes in the middle of the screen
# 1 is the game, where several still nodes are put in sequence and the others get docked to them
# 2 is similar to 0, but the distance of a node to the center defines how often/fast it gets triggered
GameNumber=2

# StillNodeCount defines how many still nodes at game 2 will be on the field from the beginning
StillNodeCount=6
